4. Shipping Charges
Shipping charges are calculated at checkout based on the weight, dimensions, and destination of your order. Free shipping may be available for orders over a certain amount, as indicated on the Website.
International orders may be subject to additional customs duties, taxes, or fees, which are the responsibility of the recipient.

5. Tracking Your Order
Once your order has shipped, you will receive a tracking number via email. You can use this number to track the status of your shipment on the carrier's website.

If a package is returned to us as undeliverable due to an incorrect address, refusal, or failure to claim, we will contact you to arrange reshipment. Additional shipping charges may apply.
If you do not respond within 7 days, your order may be canceled and a refund issued, minus shipping fees.

7. Damaged or Lost Packages
If your package arrives damaged or is lost in transit, please contact us within 5 business days of the expected delivery date. We will work with the carrier to resolve the issue and, if necessary, send a replacement or issue a refund.
Please retain all packaging materials and take photos of any damage to assist with the claims process.
