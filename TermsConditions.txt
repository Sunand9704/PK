You agree that you will not use the Website for any unlawful purpose or to solicit others to perform or participate in any unlawful acts.

4. Product Information
We strive to display as accurately as possible the colors, features, specifications, and details of the products available on the Website. However, we do not guarantee that the colors, features, specifications, and details of the products will be accurate, complete, reliable, current, or free of other errors.
All product images are for illustrative purposes only. Actual products may vary from the images shown. Product availability is subject to change without notice.

By providing payment information, you represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use the payment method and that the information is accurate and complete.

6. Shipping and Delivery
We will make every effort to ship your order within the timeframe specified on the Website. However, delivery times are estimates only and may vary due to circumstances beyond our control.
Risk of loss and title for items purchased pass to you upon delivery of the items to the carrier. You are responsible for filing any claims with carriers for damaged and/or lost shipments.

7. Returns and Refunds
We want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase. If you are not satisfied, you may return most items within 30 days of delivery for a refund or exchange.
Items must be returned in their original condition, unworn, unwashed, and with all original tags attached. Return shipping costs are the responsibility of the customer unless the item was received damaged or defective.

Our total liability to you for any claims arising from the use of the Website shall not exceed the amount you paid to us in the 12 months preceding the claim.

10. Governing Law
These Terms shall be interpreted and governed by the laws of the United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.
If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.

11. Changes to Terms
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect.
What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our Website after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.
